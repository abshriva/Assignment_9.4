<h2>The million dollar man</h2><br>
<h5>April 2, 2017, 12:22 PM IST Sunil Sharan in Strategic Insights | World | TOI</h5>
<br>
<br>
King Raheel. The day-before’s saviour. Yesterday’s villain. Today’s hero. Oh, Nawaz, will you ever learn? Three times you have picked an army chief. Three times you have botched up.
But you still won’t stop, will ya? Let’s see how the fourth one pans out.
<br>
<br>
<br>
It wasn’t to be this way with King Raheel. Nawaz’s cabinet confidante, Lt. Gen. Abdul Qadir Baloch (Retd.) considered King Raheel his son and strongly endorsed him to Nawaz. Nawaz fell for the King, additionally because he was Punjabi like Nawaz.
Nawaz passed over two more senior and supposedly more martial generals for the King. The King was only in a backwater, heading the training arm of the army. But as soon as he got anointed the king, his animal spirits got re-released and he started stomping around.
First stop India. Nawaz comes over.
<br>
<br>
<br>
The King blows up an Indian asset in Afghanistan. Then Narendra bhai goes across. The King blows up Pathankot, and another Indian asset in Afghanistan. When will these bloody civvies get who the hell, well who the hell is the king?
The King puts Imran Khan in a container to put Nawaz in a bottle. IK comes out beaming when summoned by the King, thinking that the prime ministership is finally his. But he’s used and cast aside. Kings know how to rule.
<br>
<br>
<br>
The King is everywhere now. Launching surgical strikes against empty Talibani mud huts after alerting them weeks in advance to scam. He takes sole charge of the hangman’s noose, and reports of his daily executions are broadcast far and wide by his propaganda goon.
He loves policy. Foreign policy. The King forces Nawaz to retain just an advisor, no foreign minister. A Hina Rabbani Khar with her oh so chic Prada goggles and Louis Vuitton purses would have been an eyesore. Not for the Indians though. They were totally bowled over by the fair maiden.
<br>
<br>
<br>
He is able to somewhat pacify his country. All hail the King, the saviour of the people. But time is running out for him. Posters mysteriously appear all over Pakistan, even inside strictly-bound army cantonments, imploring the King to take over and save the country. From Nawaz. From IK. From Zardari. From itself.
